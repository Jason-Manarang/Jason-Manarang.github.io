        <p>
           This was my first History assignment of the year. We had to act if we were natives to a new land. We were placed somewhere in the world and had to figure out how we would live as a community. This assignment was also a group activity and I learned how civilizations first started out.

           <p> This project was created from Graphics III. The project was meant to similuate how it would be like to work for a graphic design company. We had to make various designs that will show us what we learned in graphic design III. We had to show that we understood fair use and portion limitations.</p>

        <p>
            In US History, we had to pick an event that happened and make a news report on it live in front of the whole class. I found this assignment quite fun and educational. I learned more about the 1800's and the culture and lifestyle. We also learned how to make a script for live performances.</p>

        <p>
            My group and I were tasked to make a story about a historical event.My team and I picked the Election of 1800 because we had the most knowledge on what happened. I was tasked to worked on the second part of the story. I took the place of Thomas Jefferson and I had to make sure the story was historically true and make sure it was interesting.</p>

       <header> <h2>Winter PBL 2016.</h2> 
        <p>
            This PBL was really fun and also challenging. We had to teach elementary schoolers and middle schoolers on how to make an app. The assignment was challenging bebcause I was lost most of the time and I had trouble appealing my presentation to the audience. We had a maximum time of eightteen minutes to get our lesson out to the kids.</p>
